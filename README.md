The Committee Chair's Play Book

The Committee Chair's Play Book (CCPB) is intended to provide Cub Scout pack Committee Chairs a quick reference for unique challenges they will face in the role.  The CCPB is organized by topic into short references to reduce the relearning and let the CC focus on supporting the BSA's Cub Scout program. 

The CCPB is one of my Wood Badge ticket goals.  I arrived at the idea after several years as a Committee Chair, relizing that I still have new challenges daily.  The turnover in leaders in Cub Scouting is much higher than other BSA programs.  With a wealth of experience available across thousands of individuals there is no reason even a brand new CC should need to start from scratch.  The CCPB will provide a warm-start based on existing community knowledge.
